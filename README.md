This project is about reviewing all that i have learned with html

Mainly:
Elements and tags and attributes 
HTML boilerplate (what does it all mean again)
Text (the p and the h1 the hierarchy)
Lists (ul and ol propper nesting too)
Links and images(what type of imagine is used for what and when, absolute and relitive links)
