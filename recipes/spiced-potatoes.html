    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Apparently these were not for us. I didn't read the reviews before making, and I think that I should have. I thought they were way too spicy and I honestly couldn't eat them. They just didn't suit our tastes. Sorry, still thank you for posting.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a winner. My family is fond of spicy foods and I made them in place of the usual spanish rice with our burrito dinner. I will definitely make these again. I used Yukon gold potatoes and substituted the onion salt for onion powder and kosher salt (what I had on hand). They were perfect. We had a few left over and they quickly went the next day. Thanks for the recipe!</p>
