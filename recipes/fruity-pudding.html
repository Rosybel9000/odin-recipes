    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I used french vanilla pudding and a fruit cocktail called Very Cherry by Del Monte. It gave it extra yummy flavor. Very quick and easy!</p>
    <p>I'm sorry....this may be quick, but it's just too "chemical". It tastes like something made in a laboratory, not a kitchen.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can fruit cocktail, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pudding according to package directions; refrigerate until chilled.</li>
        <li>Fold in the whipped topping and fruit; chill and serve.</li>
    </ol>
